description: "Five day\u2013long Lagrangian trajectories observed by freely\u2013\
  drifting floats (green worms) and the Eulerian horizontal current vector measured\
  \ by a fixed current meter (black vector) that is scaled similarly. The approximate\
  \ equality of these measurements is a demonstration of the Fundamental Principle\
  \ of Kinematics. These data are a snapshot from a four month\u2013long period that\
  \ is animated in the cover page of the essay on Lagrangian and Eulerian representations\
  \ of fluid flow. (Image by James F. Price. Used with permission.)"
