  caption: "Five day\u2013long Lagrangian trajectories observed by freely\u2013drifting\
    \ floats (green worms) and the Eulerian horizontal current vector measured by\
    \ a fixed current meter (black vector) that is scaled similarly. The approximate\
    \ equality of these measurements is a demonstration of the Fundamental Principle\
    \ of Kinematics. These data are a snapshot from a four month\u2013long period\
    \ that is animated in the cover page of the essay on Lagrangian and Eulerian representations\
    \ of fluid flow. (Image by James F. Price. Used with permission.)"
